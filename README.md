# Text classification model
The repository includes two text classification models, which are used to classify junk information and useful information about earthquake on social media. CNN.py establishes the model based on TextCNN (training processes include different types of data), while ensemble.py uses a ensemble model, i.e. TextCNN + LSTM.
Another python file is used to test the model, and the test data sets have been provided.
For training two different models, training data sets have also been provide with two stop words lists.
